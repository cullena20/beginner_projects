# beginner_projects
Three of my first Python projects. Posting the coffee machine file from the edu file was a bit too messy, so I decided to paste the code into a seperate project.
I also addded two other simple projects I did to learn while I worked on the coffee machine. I've done tons of problems, but these are the main three projects
I did. These three projects gave me a good grasp of the fundamentals and have me excited to make more complex and interesting things.

## Coffee Machine
My first main Python project coded following Jetbrains Academy. A user can run five commands on a coffee machine; buy, fill, take, remaining, and exit.
While learning basic concepts and doing practice problems, this is the main project I worked on. It involves boolean logic, functions, loops, and
classes.

## Basic ATM
The lesson about function decomposition inspired me to make this basic atm. The user must enter a valid number and pin (only one works per instance of the
Atm class), and is able to deposit, withdraw, or display their balance. I did this project to practice writing functions to solve problems, and returned to it
after finishing the coffee machine to add some extra functionality. This project was good practice but it feels kind of sloppy.

## Airlines Miles Calculator
The first project I made while working on the coffee machine. I did this project to practice applying some of my new skills to make a novel tool. I
did not update this one after finishing the Coffee machine.
